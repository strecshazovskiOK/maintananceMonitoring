# Maintenance Monitoring System (Demo Simulation)

This repository contains a **demo simulation** version of a real, functional Maintenance Monitoring System. The original system is designed to monitor equipment health, track anomalies, and support predictive maintenance strategies in real-world environments.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project is **only a simulation** created for demonstration purposes. It mimics the behavior of the actual system but does not connect to real hardware or sensors.

## 🎯 Purpose

The simulation showcases the structure and basic logic behind the original working system. It is useful for:

- Demonstrating the core functionalities without requiring physical hardware
- Testing and developing new features in a safe, simulated environment
- Sharing the system architecture with collaborators or stakeholders

## 🚀 Features (Simulated)

- Simulated sensor data for vibration, temperature, etc.
- Anomaly detection logic to mimic real-time monitoring
- Logging of system events and simulated alerts
- Modular codebase that mirrors the structure of the production version
